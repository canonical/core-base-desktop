# Apply a build variant's payload to a rootfs that is being assembled.
#
# Usage: apply-variant-payload.sh <rootfs> <variant>
#
# Called from the Makefile "install" target (and exercised by
# hook-tests/995-variant-payload.test). <rootfs> is the rootfs the base
# snap is assembled into, <variant> the value of SNAP_BUILD_VARIANT.
# See variants/README.md for the payload layout.
#
# Runs inside the snapcraft build environment as root, with the current
# directory set to the project source tree.
