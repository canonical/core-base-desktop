# Build a named variant of the core26 base snap and pack it as
# core26-<variant>_<version>_<arch>.snap.
#
# Usage: tools/build-variant.sh <variant>
#
# Selection works like the Launchpad recipes do: a "build-env" file
# with SNAP_BUILD_VARIANT=<variant> is written into the project root
# and removed again after the build (see variants/README.md).
#
# The snap name cannot be changed inside the build: snapcraft.yaml's
# project name is static (changing it would swap snapcraft's
# project-keyed LXD build instance and lose the incremental build
# state). The packed snap is therefore packed a second time from the
# build instance's prime directory with meta/snap.yaml's name patched,
# as real root inside the LXD container, so file ownership and the /dev
# device nodes survive the round trip. Requires the snapcraft LXD
# provider (the default for this project).
#
# Run from the project root as the user that normally runs snapcraft;
# any http_proxy for the build environment must be set by the caller.
# The per-repo build lock ("flock", as used by the local go-build
# wrappers) is not taken here; don't run concurrent builds of the same
# project.
